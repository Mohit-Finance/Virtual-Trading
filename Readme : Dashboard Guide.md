# 📊 Virtual Options Trading Dashboard (Python + Excel)

This project is a **live virtual trading simulator** for Nifty, BankNifty, and Sensex options.  
It streams real-time option prices, lets you place buy/sell trades instantly, executes automatic breakout/breakdown strategies, applies target and stop-loss orders, and maintains a complete trade history — all without risking real money.

It’s like a **flight simulator for traders**: you experience real market conditions, practice automation logic, and learn discipline, margin control, and cost-awareness.

## 🗂 Dashboard Overview

### 🔹 Market Data Inputs (Excel Sheet)
- **Spot Price LTP:** Live index spot price tick by tick.
- **Synthetic ATM Strike:** Live index spot price tick by tick.
- **Cell C2 (Lot Size):** Lot size of the selected index (e.g., Nifty = 75).
- **Cell C3 (Max Lot/Order):** Default = 24. Larger orders are auto-split.  
  Example → Entering 48 lots = 2 × orders of 24 lots (1800 qty each).
- **Cell C4 (Expiry):** Current expiry contract (always most liquid).
- **Cell C6 (Strike Price):** Custom strike entry (ATM ± 5 strikes visible).
- **Cells B6 & D6 (CE/PE LTP):** Auto-updating LTPs for strikes.
- **Cell D1 (ATM):** Current At-The-Money strike.
- **Cell D3 (Qty):** Final trading quantity (Lot Size × Lots entered).  
👉 **Excel is used only for input (strike, lot, target/SL).**

## 🔀 Automated Entry Logic

To make trading fully automated, you can configure the type of order in **Cell C7** and specify the trigger price in **Cell B7 or D7** (depending on CE/PE).

### 🔹 Breakout Buy Order (BBO)
- Entered price **must be ABOVE current LTP**.  
- When LTP rises to or beyond this price → **Buy order is triggered immediately**.  
- Target and Stop Loss can be pre-set → making entry and exit automatic.

### 🔹 Sell Breakdown Order (SBD)
- Entered price **must be BELOW current LTP**.  
- When LTP falls to or below this price → **Sell order is triggered automatically**.  
- Target/Stop Loss can also be auto-applied (optional).

### 🔹 Buy Limit Order (BLO)
- Entered price **must be BELOW current LTP**.  
- When LTP touches or falls below this price → **Buy order is placed**.  
- Used when you want to buy on dips.

### 🔹 Sell Limit Order (SLO)
- Entered price **must be ABOVE current LTP**.  
- When LTP touches or moves above this price → **Sell order is placed**.  
- Used when you want to sell at higher levels.

## 🔹 Trade Summary (Day-Wise Log)
(Table: H2:K5)
- Profit / Brokerage / Net Profit / Points Captured  
- Winning Trades / Losing Trades / Total Trades  
✔️ **Resets daily** and auto-saves to: `Credentials/Trade_log`

---

## ⚡ Hotkeys Reference (CMD Window) - Placing and Exiting Manual Order (Scalping)
- CE Buy → `Z + UP`  
- CE Sell → `Z + DOWN`  
- PE Buy → `X + UP`  
- PE Sell → `X + DOWN`  
- ATM Straddle Buy → `B + UP`  
- ATM Straddle Sell → `B + DOWN`  
- Exit All → `DELETE × 2`  
- Refresh Brokerage/Margin → `r`  

👉 **CMD must be active** when pressing keys.

---

## 🔹 Target & Stop Loss Settings
(Table: H7:K9)
- Enter target & stop loss in **points**, not ₹.  
- Entering `0` = no target or SL.  
- Both values must be **positive**.  

Special Case: **Straddle Mode** (Table H11:K13)  
- If enabled (`H11=1`):
  - One leg hitting Target/SL closes only that leg.
  - Other leg stays active until it hits its Target/SL.
  - Option to set **combined target/SL** (cells I8 & I9).
- Default = `H11=0` (inactive).

---

## 🔹 Brokerage & Margin Calculator
(Table: M2:O12)
- Brokerage = Entry + Exit (round trip).  
- Updates automatically based on lots in C3 (`press r` to refresh).  
- Shows required margin for:
  - Single-leg Buy/Sell trades  
  - Straddle Buy/Sell trades  
✔️ Helps estimate costs before placing an order.
